# vim-todo

[sherking@gmail.com](mailto:sherking@gmail.com)

This is a clone from the vim-scripts @ [https://github.com/vim-scripts/TODO-List](https://github.com/vim-scripts/TODO-List).

This clone adds a new definition of prefix and indentation.

Just set the following as the modeline, so that there is no need to change the vimrc.

```vim
/* vim: set ft=todo fdm=indent fdc=4: */
```
